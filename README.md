# SWAMPy tools

Welcome to the SWAMPy tools QGIS plugin repository! Swampy helps users to build coastal groundwater models (2D only so far) using the Flopy library to implement SEAWAT models. The user can  quickly set up a SEAWAT model at a desired location along the global coastline via an interface that splits the setup stages into multiple tabs. Starting at the geographical location and grid size defintion, followed by hydrogeological settings, specifying initial conditions, stress periods and boundary conditions and finally defining SEAWAT parameters before running the model itself. Once the model is succesfully terminated the user can plot the groundwater salinity distribution at each model time step.

Swampy development was funded via the Future Deltas programme of Utrecht University and via Deltares research institute and is still under further development which will bring new features in the future. If you have any issues with installing/using swampy or have suggestions for features you would like to have included in future versions please contact me at daniel.zamrsky@gmail.com! 

Hope you will enjoy the SWAMPy tools to the fullest!
